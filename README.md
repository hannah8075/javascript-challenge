There are two folders UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2, each containing html, JavaScript, and CSS files. The data is stored as a data.js file. In the Level 1 folder, the data table columns include date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment. The user is allowed to find rows that matches users' input using date form. 

In Level 2, multiple input tags are used to set mutliple search filters. Searchable criteria are:
